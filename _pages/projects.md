## Projects

### [Provable Non-convex Optimization for Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/provable-non-convex-optimization-for-machine-learning-problems/)
Several ML problems can be posed as non-convex optimization problems which in general are hard to solve. The goal of this project is to explore certain problem structues to solve these "hard" non-convex optimization problems efficiently. Click [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/provable-non-convex-optimization-for-machine-learning-problems/) for more information and links to talks, our publications etc. 

### [Intelligent Tiny Devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/resource-efficient-ml-for-the-edge-and-endpoint-iot-devices/)
Can we devise tiny ML models that can fit in 2KB of RAM and enable tiny devices to be "intelligent"? Click  [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/resource-efficient-ml-for-the-edge-and-endpoint-iot-devices/) for more information. 

### [Robust ML Models](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/provable-non-convex-optimization-for-machine-learning-problems/)
Traditionally, ML models have been designed assuming "benign" i.i.d. data. However, in practice, one often encounters datasets with several outliers (possibly malicious/adversarial). The goal of this project is to develop ML methods that are robust to such outliers but still efficiently learns nearly optimal models.
